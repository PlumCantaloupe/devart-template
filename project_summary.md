## Description ##
A piece running across three screens that aims to raise awareness about the roles of techonology and consumerism in distracting us from social issues. This piece will provide a literal pedestal for which indivduals will be detected on teh midle screen (using OpenCV) so that dozens of tendrils can be sprouted from their heads, with text of all the items their fellows humans "need" or "want" slithing through each like a snake in grass (provided by the Google+ API). As the individual stares at their shadowy form the tendrils will grow larger and larger until they cover the entire installation and all the slowing falling background words denoting issues such as the poor, social disparity, economic disparity, environment, love etc. are covered. I aim not to guilt people about their possessions but rather ask us all to question what is important in life.
