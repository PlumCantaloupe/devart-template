# MEDuSA #
  
#### Anthony Carlo Scavarelli, PlumCantaloupe ####

## Description ##
A piece running across three screens that aims to raise awareness about the roles of technology and consumerism in distracting us from social issues using the metaphor of a reflection averse Medusa. This minimalist piece will provide a literal pedestal for which individuals can have dozens of tendrils sprouting from their heads, with text of all the items their fellow humans "need" or "want" slithering through each like a snake in grass (provided by the Google+ API). As the individual stares at their own shadowy form the tendrils will grow larger and more numerous until they cover the entire installation and all the slowing falling background words denoting issues such as the poor, social disparity, economic disparity, environment, love etc. To push back the snakes of materialism one must choose to step off the pedestal. I aim not to guilt people about their possessions but rather ask us all to question what is important in life.
