# Further Concept and Planning (Living Document) #

I tend to do a lot of planning and sketching before I do much any real coding so I can have a better idea of how long a project will take, so this post will focus on some rough timeframes and further conceptualization. Undoubtedly this project will grow into many forms throughout this entire process but it is best to get a sense of what I might expect as go along towards a complete project in the near to far future. Also because of this I will be constantly editting this project as I further this project.

## Refined Concepts ##

The following image is a rough render of how I want the installation to feel.

This next image is how the installation will likely actually look.

Rough materials include so far _WIP_:
- 1 computer to run 3 1080p screens without a TripleHead2Go for highest image fidelity (have a WinBox at home that can do this)
- 1 PS3Eye camera withe IR filter removed (want 60fps at 320x240)
- 1 USB extension (with booster) if the computer is far enough away
- 3 1080p screens at around 60" each
- 3 TV stands that allow 90degree rotation
- Possibly 3 frames to cover 'TVness'
- Standing marker (likely a round vinyl sticker or pad I can put on the floor)


## Tasks and Timeframes ##

I have two or three events I would like to prototype the piece at before I 'complete' the project for teh March 28th DevArt deadline. This give me very tangible and significant milestones to reach for while also allowing for testing the installation in live settings. Things are always different when performed live, especially when it concerns lighting with computer Vision and usability when considering participant interaction. The first event will be scheduled for February 28th and the second for about March 14th. I may add a third one in the future after that.

First a list of all tasks with a number attached to priority (out of 5, 1 most important and 5 nice to have) _WIP_.

### TaskList ###
- () create circle graphic
- () create tentacle graphics
- () create base list of 'social issues'
- () create particcle system to have 'social issues' falling
- () create procedural tentacle creation system
- () create tentacle animation from large to small and small to large
- () create circle animation
- () create particle system for detailed effects
- () create lighting system for particles
- () render to three screens
- () capture video image from surroundings
- () detect figure or face in video capture
- () create optical flow system for moving tentacles a bit from outside influence
- () create 'I want' basic list
- () create 'I want' capture from Google+ system
- () create 'I want' to texture system
- () animate 'I want' textures down tentacles


And now a list of milestones.

### Milestones ###
- __Design Start__: February 6th
- __Coding Start__: February 12th
- __First Milestone:__ February 27th, night club
- __Second Milestone:__ March 14th, cello performance
- __Final Milestone:__ March 28th, DevArt Completion Date

After going over these lists and milestones, as well as concepts, over teh next couple of days I will determine an appropriate estimated timeframe and add that here.

### Timeframes ###
