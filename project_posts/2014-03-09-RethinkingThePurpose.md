# Rethinking the Purpose

## An Amazing 13.3 Minutes
I have recently watched an amazing video lately, and it is likely one of the best ways to spend 13 minutes today, yesterday, or tomorrow.

Created for the GlobalPOV impetus, and narrated by Dr. Ananya Roy, from the University of Berkley, this piece tries to shed light onto our misguided notions on the poor, middle-class and wealthy, while also touching on how "government hand-outs" affect us all. __It is powerful, and most importantly guided towards trying to enact social change__, something that is arguably way past due in many countries, and definitely our own in North America (Canada and the United States). This particular piece focuses on The United States but being Canadian I also see parallels in our current government that also seems driven by corporate interests at the expense of the environment (oil sands), the lower class (social programs slashed), arts (arts funding slashed), and foreign "appearances" taking precedence over action (G20 Summit). It is an unfortunate state that we also find ourselves with a growing inequality between the rich and poor, as Dr. Roy points out, the difference between the 1% and 99% hasn't been so large since the Great Depression - this is a problem.

The beauty of the GlobalPOV and Developmental Impact Lab at Berkley is that it isn't just an honourable movement, but one run by both researchers and activists. There is no need for false propaghanda because our currently lop-sided condition is being highlighted through arguments factually framed within the scientific literature.

But how do we enact change? How can I, as an emerging interactive artist, enact change?

## Concept is Just as Important as Design

Within the current interactive art world I find many of us are more concerned about design and technology over concept and meaning. We are fascinated by the technology and aim to create something interesting from it; but from this the discussion about a certain piece of art becomes about the technology itself (cool lights, cool movement, cool interaction). I do not believe this to be an invalid approach to creating "art"; but I have been conflicted lately about the seeming majority of this technique as I really want people to talk not just about the technology but also what the the technology represents - the __"why" as opposed to the "how"__. In this sense I am inspired by Marshall McLuhan and his famous idea - __"the medium is the message."__ I would rather people ask "why is this like this?" and "Why this technology?", rather than "how is this like this?". It is a subtle but very important difference - the how means we are concerned about how it was created, and with the why we are concerned with why it was created. I want people to see interactive art not as something "new and cool" but rather another artistic expression that encourages meaningful discussion about the world. Most of my work involves augmenting the world in some way, and this allows for some very purposeful design on just "why" it is done as it opens up some interesting analogs between the real world and how we want the real world to be.

Watching Dr. Anaya Roy's video above I was struck by just how important it is to try and get people to "think", which hopefully translates into "action." __I have always loved coming to a piece that stopped and made you question why it was even done in the first place, begging us to question its existence__, and then finally, possibly hours later, coming to sort of conclusion within our own minds, hopefully by discussing with others. I think modern western society is so busy so focused on working during the day, and then being distracted by  "tvs, video games, smartphones, hollywood gossip etc." in the evenings that sometimes it is easy to forget why life is the way it is currently. We forget to vote, we forget look both ways before we cross the street, and we forget to see the older lady behind us having trouble carrying her bags. I want to help break people out of their matrix-like state of living and encourage them to consider, albeit for a moment, how can we make the world better place. For this to work a great deal many of us much do not only this, but also come together to support each other as we stand against our contemporary "issues".

## The Current State of The Art

From all these thoughts that have crossed my mind recently, I am finding the piece I currently have envisioned is too focused on the individual. It is true that we must choose to act as individuals; but just as importantly, when we act, we must do so together for our voice to be heard by those in their ivory towers on Parliament Hill and in their mansions and penthouses paid for by opening the Earth, and paying non-living wages to the employees of their company. I am not a mouthpiece that can rally people together but I do enjoy and can create art that encourages participation. My part may be small but it is a part I can play nonethless. 

__The piece I create must not be about the technology, but rather a enduring utilization of the technology to tell a story, that hopefully others will pass on.__ I am not disillusioned by my chances of reaching a large audience but I believe in the effort, and hopefully at least one might stop and consider in front of the glowing screens I intend to put up.

My current focus on the individual is not ill-intentioned, though it feels so, but it is only half the story. Yes, we must try and wake up, but also __we must work together to enact the change we want to see__. Over the next few days I am going to work on changing my piece to focus not on the individual but a group of individuals. I want people to feel as if they can contribute a small change as one, but a greatly amplified change effect when many.
