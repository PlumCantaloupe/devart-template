# Initial Thoughts

## The Challenge
What a challenge to create something that pushes the boundaries of the technology while also traversing the outer limits of how technology can be reappropriated for art in two months! A worthy one though. At the very least a way to push myself as a technology-based artist with a schedule and impetus in the form of someone possibly watching. I have often thought of a performance art piece where I sit in a public space coding away on my computer and plucking away at screens, projectors, and Arduinos at a desk or, my favourite, in bed (terrible for posture I am sure). Until I can realize that likely unoriginal idea this seems like good practice.

## The Idea
Often when I am challenged with coming up with a concept I start with a pen and paper. In design and in art I find it so useful to move away from the technology and use something that doesn't allow me to undo or erase, not being inhibited, or distracted, by a blinking cursor and pop-up notifications. So my first two images are of a mind-map of three very important concepts to what I want this project to be - Interactivity, the cello, and Google.

- **Interactivity** is the ultimate art form to me as it allows anyone to contribute to the piece. In an age where we all feel we can add to a global conversation (through technologies like Twitter and Google+) to determining the fates of others ideas (Kickstarter) I think one the best ways to connect with an individuals or groups of individuals is to let them see an art not as something behind a glass with a pre-determined meaning but rather a piece that invites others to touch it. When they can literally project themselves into a piece of art, so as to become a co-creator of it I think it can empowering, and a great way to engage those normally turned away by the concept of an exhibit filled by the sound of academic debates on its meaning 10ft away from the piece.
- The **cello** is such a beautiful instrument, often noted as the instrument closest in tonal ranges to the human voice with a human sounding timbre to match. It can be engrossingly emotional and I try to use it everywhere I can, and yet to be honest , in this instance I am attempting to be pragmatic. I play the cello a bit and really want to use this piece to showcase a cellist friends new record performance in March. There is no room for a cello just yet in my initial concept of "MedUsa" but in later iterations I would like there to be :)
- And finally **Google** is a mandatory requirement of this project, and I hope to make better use of the many technologies Google affords as this project continues. At this time however I imagine using websearch and Google+ feeds to bring in textual content and ideas.

## Considerations

### New Media and Technology
One thing I find in many new media projects is that often they become explorations of technologies moreso than an exploration of ideas. It is easy to find some really amazing new technology or code and then try to find a use for it; but often these can turn out to appear more as technology demonstration rather than a proper utilization of the technology to create meaning. In this sense I think technology, particularly in its almost limitless possibilities, should be thought of more as a tool to create interesting content. When I use technology I should try to use it is a way that makes it unique to some other medium. For example, using a tablet to show a skeuomorphic presentation of a paper newspaper seems a terrible waste of its potential, but using a tablet to allow for videos, bookmarks, search, and a layout more conducive to a smaller sized experience seems a better one.

### The User/Participant
Another important consideration in an interactive piece is not only the output or processing, but also its input. Perhaps as I am currently studying HCI as a graduate degree I am more aware of it but having an experience that makes it really easy for others to understand and use interactive installation is a hugely underrated concept. Unless the point of the piece is to create disinterest or discomfort (could be fun!) thinking about how a "participant” who stands in front of an interactive piece would instinctively try to interact with an installation is hugely important to determining  how best to create that interaction with an installation. If a participant cannot easily use an installation, oreasily understand how their interaction is affecting it, the experience will be much less impactful, or impactful in an negative manner.

### The Context
The last thing I want to consider in this piece is where it will be set up.  Environmental and social context can make a huge difference in how this piece works within the space. For now I want to focus on two similar venues – a “party atmosphere with music” and a cello concert. As both will be filled with loud sounds, and in the case of the concert one sound meant to be undistracted, I will likely not use any sound in this piece. Also as in both case it will be in s space with many people I will try to make it as large as possible, and as “strange” so that it stands out. Also with many people and areas filled with large amounts of ambient light I do not want to use projection as it can be washed out and covered in unintentional shadows. At this point I am imaging my three screens to be large HD televisions rotated 90 degrees and covered with simple black or white pictures frames to cover the “TVness.”

## The Concept ##
The initial concept I am working on involves visually representing our insatiable desire for "things" hiding or covering significant issues that we could be discussing, particularly as youth that are large in numbers but low in voice. I feel some responsibility in doing what I can do bring light to social issues, and so I aim to create a piece that touches upon many of the issues we face without a lack of heavy-handedness.

![First Rough Sketch of MedUsa](../project_images/Sketch_1.jpg?raw=true "First Rough Sketch of MedUsa")

I enjoy more minimalistic pieces as they tend to make the concept and purpose clearer, less cluttered. There is only a message and no frivalities. In this vein I have been often thinking of a multi-screen piece that utilizes large amounts of white space with one or few elements. The central element I see as a circle as it creates such an interesting and universally balanced shape, that when floating in a see of white helps me to focus on our own detachment from the world around us. Sometimes we feel so disconnected, particularly as youth, trying to determine our position in the seemingly causal system at the worst of times and a limited system of choice the best of times. I do not believe things are so dire but it is easy to fall into the trappings of such a notion. We become so disenfranchised by the current notions of power, and the system that maintains them, that most of us don't even go out to vote anymore. So many of us say something along the lines of "it is what it is" when something or someone disappoints us as if there were no change possible - I have heard it said so many times. We see the rich getting richer and the poorer getting poorer. We see rebellions break out across the ocean and yet the we, ourselves, do not act. What will it take? I am not sure, and so I focus on the possible whys, trying not to claim I know the answer. I merely want to evoke the question.

### An Anecdote
On the way home on a bus once my wife was siting beside a teenage girl on her phone lamenting how her dad didn't buy a plane ticket instead of a train ticket, and also that "finally" her phone is now broken so that her dad can buy her the latest and greatest smartphone. The situation was so bizarre that it felt a badly written script and yet here we are. I feel like our access to such "luxury" items have started to blind us a bit from thinking about the issues we and others find ourselves in. So I propose a piece that visualizes this in a more abstract form, based on the concept of a "Medusa" - the terrible beast from the depths of a Greek Temple that never looks at herself for fear of turning to stone, and yet here she is wandering the darkness to turn anyone else to stone that dares look upon her. Self-reflection and judgment are powerful concepts that I feel are highly relatable in today's society. 

### The Setup
I envision multiple screens helping the installation stand out in a crowd, as well as harking back to a theme of mirrors as they overlap and mirror each slighty with a slightly uncomforting offset. The middle screen (of 3 or 5 screens in total) will be the main screen that has a floating circle "in a sea of white nothingness." The nothingness will also not quite be nothing but will have, requiring closer inspection, words slightly falling from the top to the bottom as if slowly falling rain. These words will literally represent many of the issues that I think face us a society. As someone stands in front of the circle, which I will mirror on the floor as well to help draw attention to the idea of standing on it, tendrils will start to emerge from the circle approximately at the height of the participants head. They will emerge with a basic AI/flocking behaviour that will simulate life and they will grow longer and longer as the participant continues to stand in position. They will start to grow so long and plentiful that they will start to cover the whiteness and words falling, eventually covering all screens as if they were choking the space. Each of these "tendrils" will take a random post from Google+ from someone lamenting their need or want of some "thing" and that post, in textual form, will slide along the tendril as a texture on its surface slowly to the end as it grows. 

I am still thinking on specifics but to have the tendrils grow smaller I feel that if the user gets off the pedestal they will grow smaller until eventually they are completely gone. I am not sure if this interaction is satisfactory in an artistic and mechanical/usability sense. It might be that as the participant decides to removes themselves from the centre "of the world" they can start to see the rest of it but I am unsure just yet. I also have to think more clearly on how such a project meant to be in a public space can become so personal (i.e. what can secondary observers do? if anything?). I am thinking of possibly a vector field to allow secondary interaction and movement of tendrils but does this deface the concept of the piece into a "play thing" as opposed to a "thinking thing"? I am not sure. I also would still like to use this in a cello performance so I must also still think on how music may interact with it as well, and what does that mean ... lots to do yet before I even start to code!

I look forward to working more on this project, even if only to see what it is about as it seems such a unique opportunity to share with and see not only other see fellow creative/artists but also observe their own work processes.
