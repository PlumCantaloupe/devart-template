# The Role of Censorship in Art #

![Inappropriate Content](../project_images/InappropriateContent.png?raw=true "Inappropriate Content")

I just stumbled across the orange message above on my page just now, and though it really only means at least one person has deemed it 'inappropriate' it brings up a curious notion. That of the role of censorship in art, and whether it helps or hinders the process. It took a bit of Googling to find an answer to what could be defined as 'inappropriate' in this submission so I'll list it here:

> Project posts and submissions must not be: (a) derogatory, offensive, threatening, defamatory, disparaging, libelous or contain any content that is inappropriate, indecent, sexual, profane, indecent, tortuous, slanderous, discriminatory in any way, or that promotes hatred or harm against any group or person, or otherwise does not comply with the theme and spirit of the DevArt competition. (b) It must not contain content, material or any element that is unlawful, or otherwise in violation of or contrary to all applicable federal, state, provincial or local laws and regulations the laws or regulations in any state where Essay is created. (c) It must not contain any content, material or element that displays any third party advertising, slogan, logo, trademark or otherwise indicates a sponsorship or endorsement by a third party, commercial entity or that is not within the spirit of the Contest, as determined by Sponsor, in its sole discretion.

The difficult thing is that though this could be anything from a mistake to something completely unrelated to the project I must admit my mind immediately, for a brief moment, started anxiously thinking about what I did or wrote wrong in my project that could offend someone, even though the above definition is so vague as to encompass just about anything. Questions raced through my head such as should I change my topic? Should I stay away from neutrally-averse ideas? Should I stay away from commercialism? Should I not have scanned in my raw sketches? It dissapated in a moment but in that brief moment the problem of censorship in art quickly became apparent - it directs us to keep creating the acceptable and new, and to stick to what is the culturally defined 'acceptable'. This can be an interesting lesson in neutering expression (Google: 'Pussy Riot' or 'Socrates Death'), and though we may see some instances in art as more offensive than others, we all have different scales, and who is to say one scale is more authoritative than another? This is like saying something is art and the other something is not - it is too subjective. Admittedly, sometimes, a message can be much more opaque and awakening when done in a controverial manner. Is that not what we strive for? To have our work, and especially its meaning, talked about and discussed? I don't believe art is created to change anyone's mind but rather to ask them to start thinking about why their mind is set as it is in the first place. Sometimes just being asked the question is enough to start thinking about the answer.


Interestingly, and perhaps not surprisingly, there is plenty of discussion on the role of censorship in art: https://www.google.ca/search?q=censorhip+in+art&oq=censorhip+in+art&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2925j0j4&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8 .
