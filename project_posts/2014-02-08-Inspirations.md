## Inspirations ##

I was just reading through my first post and found that there was many ideas I was throwing out without reference. I did this as is truly spilled out of a subconcious inspiration; but it is not hard to see that everything created in the present is based on the foundations of the past. I just want to take a moment and list out my inspirations for creating interactive and participatory art here as an amends for not listing them previously.

They are not in any particular order of importance.

### Artistic Inspirations ###
- _Robert Hodgkins_ - His fascinating explorations of physical processes. He teaches how to use programming as a tool to create great visual art - that doesn't necessarily have to built as physically accurate systems. The end result is most important.
- Norman McClaren - His ability to use new technology in interesting forms, that also hint to larger social contexts.
- Alexandre Castoguay - I had the pleasure of working with him on Ottawa workshops giving workshops on creating Arduino powered POV (Persistance Of Vision) attcahments for bicyccles meant to help instigate social change. He teaches us how to reappropriate technology for social change.
- M.C. Escher - His ability to seemingly bend the rules with a nod to unusual forms of inspiration in the form of mathematics.
- Albert Einstein - The concept of 'though experiments' and his ability to 'imagine' strange new forms of matter (what is it like to travel at the speed of light). He teache show important it is to use how mind before your tools.
- Stanley Kubrick - An another inpisrtaion for abstractionism and the ability to tell a story while another story is actually being told.
- Shigeru Miyamoto - 
The Minalistic Movement - The meaning is most important. Not the tool or process.

### Technical Inspirations ###
- The Open Source Movement - Sharing so much so that we can all grow. I think of specifically Zack Lieberman, Joshua Noble, and so many others that are part of the OpenFrameworks and Arduino communities.
- Andrew Bell - The coding standards and creative thought into using code to build an immense framework like Cinder.
- Dr. Ali Arya - My HCI graduate supervisor. In hammering home how important it is use to use technology to it fullest potential; else otherwise use it for no good reason.
- Dr. Robert Biddle - One of my HCI graduate professors. For really asking us to think and contemplate how users inetarct with technology. The importance of though, discussion, and the concept of 'wonderfullness/unique and interesting thought' being more important than the word count.

And there are so many others I may have missed in trying to come up with this list. All our lives we are constantly inspirared both conciously and sub-conciously by everything around us - it is often difficult to differentiate between and idea and community.
