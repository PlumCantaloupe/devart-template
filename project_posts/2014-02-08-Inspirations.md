## Inspirations ##

I was just reading through my first post and found that there was many ideas I was throwing out without reference. I did this as is truly spilled out of a subconcious inspiration; but it is not hard to see that everything created in the present is based on the foundations of the past. I just want to take a moment and list out my inspirations for creating interactive and participatory art here as an amends for not listing them previously.

They are not in any particular order of importance.

### Artistic Inspirations ###
- _Robert Hodgin_ ( http://roberthodgin.com/crystalline/ ) His fascinating explorations of physical processes. He teaches how to use programming as a tool to create great visual art - that doesn't necessarily have to be built as physically accurate systems. The end result is most important.
- _Norman McClaren_ ( https://www.nfb.ca/film/neighbours_voisins/ ) His ability to use a medium in interesting forms, that also hint to larger social contexts.
- _Alexandre Castoguay_ ( http://agitpov.net/ ) I had the pleasure of working with him in Ottawa workshops giving workshops on creating Arduino powered POV (Persistance Of Vision) attachments for bicycles meant to help instigate social change.
- _Ai WeiWei_ ( http://aiweiweineversorry.com/ ) - Standing up for injustice using art as a powerful medium to do so.
- _M.C. Escher_ ( http://www.mathacademy.com/pr/minitext/escher/ ) His ability to seemingly bend the rules with a nod to unusual forms of inspiration in the form of mathematics.
- _Albert Einstein_ ( http://www.bartleby.com/173/ ) The concept of 'thought experiments' and his ability to 'imagine' strange new forms of matter (what is it like to travel at the speed of light). He teaches how important it is to use your mind before your tools.
- _Stanley Kubrick_ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film) ) An another inpiration for abstractionism and the ability to tell a story while another story is actually being told.
- _Shigeru Miyamoto_ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros. ) To think deeper about the interaction and how it best connects to the hardware (and vice-versa).
- _The Minalistic Movement_ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism ) The meaning is most important. Not the tool or process.
- _John Dewey_ ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_as_Experience ) Art being about the experience.
- _Candy Chang_ ( http://beforeidie.cc/ ) Particpants following the temnplate but ultimately creating their own artwork.

### Technical Inspirations ###
- _The Open Source Movement_ - Sharing so much so that we can all grow. I think of specifically Zack Lieberman, Joshua Noble, and so many others that are part of the OpenFrameworks, Processing, and Arduino communities.
- _Andrew Bell_ ( http://libcinder.org/ ) - The coding standards and creative thought into using code to build an immense framework like Cinder.
- _Dr. Ali Arya_ ( http://www.csit.carleton.ca/~arya/about.html ) - My HCI graduate supervisor. In hammering home how important it is use to use technology to it fullest potential; else otherwise use it for no good reason.
- _Dr. Robert Biddle_ ( http://hotsoft.carleton.ca/hotsoft/people/robert-biddle/ ) - One of my HCI graduate professors. For really asking us to think and contemplate how users interact with technology. The importance of thorough discussion, and the concept of 'wonderfullness/unique and interesting thought' being more important than the wordcount.

And there are so many others I may have missed in trying to come up with this list. All our lives we are constantly inspirared both conciously and sub-conciously by everything around us - it is often difficult to differentiate between and idea and community.
